# PuzzleSolver

#### I develop a solver using the A* search algorithm to produce the most optimal solution for the classic [Eight Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

The solution involves using A* search to find the shortest constrained path among a set of possible moves to the solution.
